### CNCF 

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosts critical components of the global technology infrastructure. CNCF brings together the world’s top developers, end users, and vendors and runs the largest open source developer conferences. CNCF is part of the nonprofit Linux Foundation.

<br>

CNCF is an open source foundation created to make cloud-native computing universal. Cloud-native technologies enable software developers to build great products, allowing businesses to move faster than ever before.

<br>

CNCF serves as the vendor-neutral home for many of the fastest-growing open source projects, including Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Envoy.

<br>

### End User Community

CNCF’s End User Community includes over 130 top companies and startups that depend on cloud native technologies and are committed to collaborative infrastructure development. The End User Community is an active participant in key technology decisions by CNCF-hosted projects. Jeff Brewer of Intuit is the End User representative to the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee.
